## My process

### Built with

- CSS

### What I learned

I got more practice laying out a page from a jpg design file. I also learned specifically how to do a colored image overlay for the purple filter effect on the image seen in this project.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I almost always consult CSS Tricks guide to flexbox when using this layout method.
- [GH-Pages Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) - Helpful to deploy to github pages.
